# learning_c-
My way to show I'm actively learning C# and not just saying so

## Project workflow
I create a new branch for the different projects I make. Then, once I've finished one, I remove the current project
of the last main's commit and replace it by the latest with a merge. Therefore, to see the different projects,
you just need to navigate through the different commits. I know this is unusal, but, that way, I'm sure to always
have only one project in my root and I prefer it that way.
